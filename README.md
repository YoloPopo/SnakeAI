# SnakeAI

## A snake game agent that uses Qâ€‘Learning to dynamically learn policies for maximizing game score.


## Credits

This project was built as part of my journey in learning reinforcement learning. I completed an online course by Patric Lober, which provided me with the knowledge and skills needed to create "SnakeAI."

I would like to express my gratitude to the instructors and the online learning community for their valuable insights and support.
